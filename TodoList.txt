Add shit to this! would be nice if we could maintain it
Needs to be done:

	Change game to iso view
		-change how spells are casted (stop movement whiel spell is casting and face that direction the mouse is at?) || (always cast in the direction you are facing)
		-change the movement script to topdown ish movements (bastion?)
		-fix the animations so they match the new controlls
		-camera controlls
		-Parts of enemy Ai needs to be rewritten

	Fix the hp script	
		-Add invurnability for a short time after getting hit (only from same spell?)
		-make one for enemies or make the existing one work for them

	Make items display on character

	Fix animations
		-Spell cast animations
		-get hit animation? -knockback?
		-Dodge stuff?
	
	Add "cast points" for spells (spell is cast when animation is at right stage)

	Add more spells! MORE! MOOOOOORE!
		-aoe attack for bushmonster

	Improve the enemy AI

	Ddd bosses!
		-fat gripphon


	Diffrent hitzones for bosses (ex more damage on head/weakzone) (for some regular enemies aswell?)
	
	Proper meny-system needs to be implemented (animated stuff looks professional)
		
	Save items and allow them to be chosen at the start

	
	





low prio (at the moment):
	level layout generation (might need to rediscuss this since iso change)
	
	?replace the lobby with a "homebase" (see dungeon defenders tarvern)?

	?hitboxes for melee attacks to match animation?
	?Add dodge movement?
